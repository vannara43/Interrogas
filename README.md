# Interrogas

Interrogas is an online platform used to provide better analysis of poll data for Mexico's elections. Interrogas is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of it. This repository contains SQL, .Net, and React code for the Locations functionality.
